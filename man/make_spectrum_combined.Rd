\arguments{
\item{mz}{A numeric vector containing m/z values for an experimental spectrum.}

\item{intensity}{A numeric vector containing intensity values for an experimental spectrum.}

\item{SNR}{Signal-to-noise cutoff to use for peak picking. See ?MSnbase::pickPeaks.}

\item{method}{Method to use for peak picking. See `?MSnbase::pickPeaks`.}

\item{refineMz}{Method for m/z refinement for peak picking. See ?MSnbase::pickPeaks.}

\item{k}{Number of neighboring signals to use for m/z refinement if refineMz = "kNeighbors". See ?MSnbase::pickPeaks.}

\item{score_matrix}{A matrix containing 12C and 14N abundances.}

\item{sequence}{Sequence of the protein represented by the m/z and intensity vectors.}

\item{PTMformula}{Chemical formula of PTMs of the proteoform represented by the m/z and intensity vectors. Formulas for all PTMs should be combined.}

\item{charge}{Charge state of the proteoform represented by the m/z and intensity vectors.}

\item{resolvingPower}{Resolving power to be used for generating the initial theoretical spectrum. This parameter does not need to match the resolving power of the experimental spectrum.}

\description{
Used to create a combined spectrum showing an experimental spectrum and peaks
picked from a theoretical spectrum generated using a score matrix, sequence,
optional PTM formula, charge, and resolving power.
